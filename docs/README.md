# Node Package Blueprint

This folder can be the right place to *read* the documentation if that's enough.

It can also be used to host files used to generate a project website, e.g. using Jekyll or other static generation tool.

If this folder contains the source code for the website. Choose a folder where the source would be generated and we can make it point to custom domain, e.g.: https://researchgate.github.io/node-package-blueprint/
